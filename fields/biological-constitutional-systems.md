# Biological Constitutional Systems

Biological Constitutional Systems is the study of living organisms as constitutionally governed systems whose biological states and actions are subject to admissibility constraints.

## Core Question
What biological states and actions are legally possible for a living system?

## Motivation
Biology traditionally models function and evolution.
This field models biological legality.

## Scope
- Biological admissibility
- Constitutional biology
- Biological operating governments
- Fail-closed life-critical states
- Permissioned physiology

## Non-Scope
- Fitness optimization
- Enhancement maximization
- Unconstrained bioengineering
