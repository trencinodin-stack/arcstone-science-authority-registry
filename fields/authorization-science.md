# Authorization Science

Authorization Science is the study of lawful permission to act or not act under uncertainty across human, institutional, machine, and hybrid systems.

## Core Question
What actions are admissible before execution?

## Motivation
Most disciplines assume action is permitted and attempt to optimize behavior afterward.
Authorization Science studies the conditions under which action is permitted at all.

## Scope
- Admissibility
- Revocation
- Fail-closed semantics
- Permission geometry
- Certificate-based legitimacy

## Non-Scope
- Optimization
- Alignment heuristics
- Capability maximization
