# Constitutional Mathematics

Constitutional Mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that encode legal, constitutional, and admissibility constraints as first-class mathematical objects.

## Core Question
How can mathematics express what is permitted, not merely what is possible?

## Motivation
Most mathematics models capability and behavior.
Constitutional Mathematics models lawful space.

## Scope
- Admissible state spaces
- Constraint-first formalisms
- Dominance orderings
- Fail-closed inequalities
- Permission lattices

## Non-Scope
- Pure optimization theory
- Unconstrained search
- Heuristic objective maximization
