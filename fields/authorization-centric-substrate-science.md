# Authorization-Centric Substrate Science

Authorization-Centric Substrate Science is the study of physical and mathematical substrates in which authorization is a first-class property of existence rather than an external control mechanism.

## Core Question
What does reality look like when permission is a fundamental substrate property?

## Motivation
Traditional systems treat authorization as an application-layer concern.
This field studies substrates where admissibility precedes capability.

## Scope
- Permissioned existence
- Substrate-level admissibility
- Fail-closed reality models
- Authorization-first physics
- Constitutional substrates

## Non-Scope
- Policy overlays
- Access control lists
- Post-hoc restriction systems
