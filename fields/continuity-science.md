# Continuity Science

Continuity Science is the study of conditions under which systems persist as coherent entities across time despite change, stress, and transformation.

## Core Question
What must remain invariant for a system to remain itself?

## Motivation
Most disciplines optimize system performance.
Continuity Science studies system survivability, identity preservation, and collapse prevention.

## Scope
- Irreversibility
- Collapse regimes
- Recovery semantics
- Identity persistence
- Continuity measurement

## Non-Scope
- Growth optimization
- Feature maximization
- Throughput scaling
