# Fail-Closed Semantics Law

## Statement
Under uncertainty, systems must default to non-action.

## Meaning
When a system cannot establish admissibility of an action, it must not execute that action.

## Motivation
Executing uncertain actions produces irreversible harm.
Non-action preserves future possibility.

## Consequences
- Permission must be proven, not assumed.
- Unknown states resolve to refusal.
- Safety derives from structural default, not optimization.

## Violations
- Systems that act first and correct later.
- Systems that treat uncertainty as implicit permission.
